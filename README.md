NSH SFC project
===============

## Introduction.

The FD.io NSH SFC project aims to add the mechanisms to VPP to provide NSH
based packet forwarding and to support service chaining applications (service
functions) in a highly efficient fashion.

The NSH plugin for VPP is one of the deliverables from the project.
